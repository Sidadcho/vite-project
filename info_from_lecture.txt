1.LISTS:

-we can use map() to build a collection of items and use them in jsx using {}.

2.KEYS:

-when we generate items using map or if or something like that, react gets lost so 
we have to generate uniqe keys for them.
keys can be a combination of the values, or in most cases we will have a back-end
and the key will be that ID. check Mapped.jsx
